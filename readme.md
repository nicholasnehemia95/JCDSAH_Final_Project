## What is Customer Segmentation?
Market segmentation can be defined as dividing a market into distinct groups of customers, with different needs, characteristics or behavior, who might require separate products or who may respond differently to various combinations of marketing efforts (Kotler & Armstrong, 1999). </br>


## Why is Customer Segmentation Important??
### Optimation of Resources
 - Segmentation is critical because a company has limited resources, and must focus on how to best identify and serve its customers. Individual customer segments are characterized by a certain degree of within-group homogeneity that helps ensure that the members of a segment will respond in similar ways to marketing efforts. <br>
### Understanding customer positions and movement:
- By using this method, we can see which customers are potential customers and high value customers. Through Customer Relationship Management (CRM), we can hopefully convert potential Customers into high value customers, and focus our energy into high value customers. <br>
- Rerunning the model over periods of time, we can see the growth of each cluster, and evaluate whether the marketing strategies we have employed are effective or not.
### Increase Customer Retention
- By understanding the position of each customer , we can anticipate customer churn, and reduce the occurence. According to Amy Gallo from Harvard Business Review , Depending on what industry you’re in, acquiring a new customer is anywhere from five to 25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one. Furthermore, studies by Bain & Company, along with Earl Sasser of the Harvard Business School, have shown that a 5% increase in customer retention can lead to an increase in profits between 25 and 95%. 

## Recency , Frequency , Monetary Analysis
In this project , I am using a behavioral customer segmentation method, which is the RFM analysis.</br>
The RFM segments customers based on 3 main components : 
- **Recency** : How much time has elapsed since the customers last activity or transaction with the Brand?
- **Frequency** : How often has a customer transacted or interacted with the brand during a particular period of time? 
- **Monetary** : Also referred to as “monetary value,” this factor reflects how much a customer has spent with the brand during a particular period of time. 

## Why RFM Works
According to Arthur Hughes from the Database Marketing Institute, Customers who have purchased from you recently are more likely to respond to your next promotion than those whose last purchase was further in the past. This is a universal principle which has been found to be true in almost all industries: insurance, banks, cataloging, retail, travel, etc. It is also true that frequent buyers are more likely to respond than less frequent buyers. Big spenders often respond better than low spenders. <br>
By identifying these big spenders, we can focus our marketing efforts to these big spenders to make good returns.

## Goal of Project
Reducing marketing cost through targeted marketing based on RFM Analysis.

Olist is an online E-Commerce to connect shopkeepers and their products to the main marketplaces of brazil.
At the date of the last data within the dataset (17 September 2018) Olist has received it's series B Funding. 
According to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/102015/series-b-c-funding-what-it-all-means-and-how-it-works.asp#series-b-funding), startups in the series B funding round typically have substantial userbase, and are now focusing on reaching a bigger market. Through RFM analysis, we can identify potential valuable customers and hopefully convert them into regulars.
